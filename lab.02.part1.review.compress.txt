1. Go to your home directory.

Write the command that you used to do this below:
----------

cd ~

==========
2. Prove that you're in your home directory.

3. Create a new directory inside your home directory named after this class. Call it "mtec1003".

Write the command that you used to do this:
----------

mkdir mtec1003

==========
4.  A compressed archive (.tar.gz) of some lab files we're using today lives at this url: 

http://einbahnstrasse.github.io/Goldford-MTEC1003-Fall2020/labs/03/mtec1003-lab-02.tar.gz

Using a Terminal command that we learned, 
download this file to your home directory into a file called mtec1003-lab-02.tar.gz

This command should have a *flag* to specify the output file.
MAKE SURE TO NAME YOUR OUTPUT FILE: mtec1003-lab-02.tar.gz

Write the command(s) that you used to download this file:
----------

curl -o https://github.com/einbahnstrasse/Goldford-MTEC1003-OL04/blob/gh-pages/labs/02/mtec1002-lab-02.zip

==========
5.  Uncompress the file that you just downloaded. (Remember which command to use for this type of archive...)

Write the command(s) that you used to do this - as well as its output - below:
----------

tar -xvf mtec1002-lab-02.zip

tar: Error opening archive: Failed to open 'mtec1002-lab-02.zip'
==========
6.  You should now have a directory called mtec1003-lab-02 inside your mtec1003 directory, 
which is inside your home directory. Verify that this directory exists.

If the directory does not exist, start over from step #1.

Otherwise...
