cd /Users/ercelwilliams/Desktop/mtec1003/mtec1002-lab-02

12. There's a txt file version of a book located in the mtec1003-lab-02 folder.  It is in the following directory if you're in the lab folder:

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use the command called cat on the file to show its contents. 

Describe what happened below.
----------

The context of the file was displayed which was pages to a book.

Use the command, head, on the file to show the contents of the beginning of the file.  

Write the command that you used below.  Write the last line of the output below (it should be the title).

15. Using the same file...

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use less and more on the file to show the contents of the file.  Try pressing spacebar and/or q afterwards.

Write the command that you used below.  Describe what spacebar and q does after using either less or more.
----------

The spacebar brought me down the page while q exited the file.





==========
16. Describe what situations you would use the following commands for viewing files: less, more, cat, tail, head

(Some characteristics that may help your description might be the length of the file, whether or not you'd like to read the whole thing... or just the beginning or end, etc.)
----------
You would use less or more to view the contents of the file. But less shows less and doesn't load the whole file and you can scroll through the file. 
Cat allows you to create multiple files at once and shows all parts. 
Tail allows you to view the end part of a file.
Head shows you the beginning or top part of a file. 
All these commands allow you to access specific parts of files for easier navigation.

Wc pg1232.txt
